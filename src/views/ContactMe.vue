      <p>Hello! I'm Dang Tan Kiet, a passionate software developer with a keen interest in building dynamic web applications. I have a solid foundation in front-end technologies, particularly Vue.js, which I use to create interactive and user-friendly interfaces. My back-end expertise lies in Node.js and MongoDB, allowing me to develop full-stack applications that are both robust and scalable. I enjoy solving complex problems and am currently working on a vocabulary builder application, where I'm enhancing the UI and implementing features like search and pagination.</p>
